## Decision Log

### Decision: Project Structure, ORM, and Naming
**Date:** [Fill in date]
**Context:** Initial setup for Evalence platform
**Options Considered:**
1. Monorepo vs. separate repos
2. Prisma vs. TypeORM
3. Custom naming conventions vs. none

**Decision:**
- Use a monorepo for both frontend and backend
- Use Prisma as the ORM for the backend
- No specific naming conventions required

**Reasoning:**
- Monorepo simplifies code sharing and project management, and is well-supported by Render
- Prisma offers better type-safety, developer experience, and maintainability
- No naming conventions simplifies setup and onboarding

**Trade-offs:**
- Monorepo requires slightly more initial deployment configuration
- Prisma requires a code generation step and learning its schema language
