Evalence – AI-Driven Performance Review Platform
Product Requirement Document (PRD)

🎯 Overview
Evalence is a web-based, enterprise-ready platform for managing performance reviews, OKRs, and continuous feedback, enhanced with AI features. The system supports structured goal tracking, 360° reviews, feedback, analytics, and role-based access for Admin, HR, Managers, and Employees.
The platform is designed to be cost-effective, leveraging free-tier and open-source technologies wherever possible.

📌 Problem Statement
Traditional performance reviews are often time-consuming, biased, and inconsistent. Organizations struggle to implement structured goal tracking, regular feedback, and meaningful reviews at scale. This project aims to build a comprehensive performance management system, enabling goal alignment, 360° reviews, continuous feedback, and rich analytics—enhanced by AI to improve review quality, remove friction, and drive employee growth.
This is an enterprise-ready, AI-augmented platform that simplifies performance management for HR teams, managers, and employees.

The wordmark will be designed in the modern, sleek style and color palette of lattice.com

UI Theme

The entire UI must reflect the brand language, color scheme, typography, and design sensibility of lattice.com

Use MUI (Material UI) theming to achieve this look and feel
