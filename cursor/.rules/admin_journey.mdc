## Important Notes

- Admin actions have cascading effects (e.g., deleting departments affects teams, goals, reviews)

- System maintains data integrity by preserving user accounts even when organizational structures change
- Empty states and error handling are crucial for admin experience

- No audit trail means admins should be cautious with destructive actions
