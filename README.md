# Evalence â€“ AI-Driven Performance Review Platform

## Project Overview
Evalence is a modern, enterprise-ready platform for performance reviews, continuous feedback, and goal/OKR management. It leverages AI to streamline review cycles, provide actionable insights, and enhance employee engagement.

## AI Feature Highlights and Usage
- **Review Suggestions & Summaries:** Automated review text generation and sentiment analysis using Gemini API.
- **Smart Search:** Semantic search and recommendations powered by Cohere API.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live notifications and feedback analysis.

## Setup Instructions
### Local Development
- See `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example` for required environment variables.
- Standard Node.js/NPM workflow for both frontend and backend.
- **Database:** Use a managed PostgreSQL instance from Render (or similar cloud provider). No local Postgres installation required. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file using the connection string from Render's dashboard.

### Production Deployment
- Railway.com setup for backend (Node.js)
- Vercel frontend (React + MUI).
- PostgreSQL instance on Render.

Project remains heavily incomplete as I ran out of credits for 5 different AI's :(
